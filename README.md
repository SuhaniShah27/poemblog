## Untitiled poem

<p align="center">
The moving day had finally arrived,
The truck was already there,
But my boxes were only half packed,
I knew it was going to be hard, but I strived.

Looking outside the window,
I thought to myself,
Why is it so/such that I have to change?
Because I think, I think I have already stepped outside the blow.

It’s true that we live in a society of approval,
But no one seems to care about the things that really matter,
Why is it so/such that I have to change?
Because it seems to me that the world’s abysmal.

All I was looking for was evasion,
All my life I stumbled in search of meaning.
Why is it so/such that I have to change?
But soon I realized, not everything is a math equation.

I was trying to climb out of that binary web,
Everywhere I look,
There are ones and zeros.
For the first time in my life,
I wanted to change.

Saw across the room where the sunlight aimed,
There laid my boxes, only half packed,
Took a step closer,
Planning to complete my packing.

That’s when I saw that somebody left the gate open,
I ran away,
And never looked back.
