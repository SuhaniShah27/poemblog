## Moving Day

<p align="center">
  The moving day had finally arrived, <br>
  The truck was already here, <br>
  But my boxes were only half packed, <br>
  I knew it was going to be hard, but I strived.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Looking outside the window,<br>
  I thought to myself,<br>
  Why is it so that I have to change?<br>
  Because I think, I think I have already stepped outside the blow.<br>
</p>

<p align="center">
  It’s true that we live in a society of approval,<br>
  But no one seems to care about the things that really matter,<br>
  Why is it so that I have to change?<br>
  Because it seems to me that the world’s abysmal.<br>
</p>

<p align="center">
  All I was looking for was evasion,<br>
  All my life I kept stumbling in search of meaning.<br>
  Why is it so that I have to change?<br>
  But soon I realized, not everything is a math equation.<br>
</p>

<p align="center">
  I was trying to climb out of that binary web,<br>
  Everywhere I looked,<br>
  There were ones and zeros.<br>
  For the first time in my life,<br>
  I wanted to change.<br>
</p>

<p align="center">
  Saw across the room where the sunlight aimed,<br>
  There lay my boxes, only half packed,<br>
  Took a step closer,<br>
  Planning to complete my packing.<br>
</p>

<p align="center">
  That’s when I saw that somebody left the gate open,<br>
  I ran away,<br>
  And never looked back.<br>
</p>
